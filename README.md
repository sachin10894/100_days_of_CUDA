# 100_days_of_CUDA
This repo tracks the progress being made on daily basis while programming GPU Kernels for 100 days. It also contains learning and references corresponding to each day's progress.
* Mentor: [Umar Jamil] (https://github.com/hkproj/)
* Book:  Programming Massively Parallel Processors (PMPP)
* Cuda Resources: https://github.com/hkproj/100-days-of-gpu/blob/main/CUDA_RESOURCES.md
 
## Day 1
* Goal: To add two vectors
* Reference: PMPP 2nd Chapter
* Learning:
** 1. How to organize the code: Host, Device and Global
** 2. Important Functions:
*** a. cudaMalloc()
*** b. cudaFree()
*** c. cudaMemcpy()
** 3. Important Terms: Thread, Block and Grid
** 4. Identifier variables for Blocks and Threads: blockIdx.x, blockDim.x and threadIdx.x
